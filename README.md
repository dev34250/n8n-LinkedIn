**Project Title: n8n LinkedIn Auto-Poster with AI-driven Content & Image Selection**


**Overview** This repository contains an automated n8n workflow that creates and publishes LinkedIn posts on a scheduled basis using AI agents. It generates content, searches (or generates) suitable images, logs post details in Google Sheets, and sends Telegram notifications at key steps. If manual image review is skipped, posts are still published without images to maintain consistency.

## 🚀 Features

* **AI-driven Content Generation**: Uses OpenAI’s Chat Model via LangChain nodes to create engaging LinkedIn content.
* **Conditional Image Selection**: Either prompts AI to search/generate an image URL or allows manual search.
* **Google Sheets Integration**: Logs the date, image URL, and post status in a Google Sheet.
* **Telegram Notifications**: Sends updates at each major stage (content ready, saved to sheet, posted).
* **LinkedIn Posting**: Automatically creates LinkedIn posts with or without an image based on availability.
* **Scheduling & Retry**: Runs on a cron-like schedule at 11:00 AM daily with retry logic for HTTP requests.
* **Fault Tolerance**: Continues workflow even if image fetching fails, ensuring posts go out on time.

## 📦 Architecture & Workflow

Below is a high-level, step-by-step overview of how the automation operates. Each stage can be customized directly in your n8n workflow for maximum flexibility.

| Step | Component                       | Description                                                          |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | **Schedule Trigger**            | Fires daily at your specified time (default: 11:00 AM)               |
| 2️⃣  | **AI Agent (Content)**          | Generates your LinkedIn post copy via OpenAI Chat Model              |
| 3️⃣  | **Append Row to Google Sheets** | Logs the post date and reserves a row for image markup               |
| 4️⃣  | **Telegram Notification**       | Alerts you that content is generated and saved to Sheets             |
| 5️⃣  | **Wait Node**                   | Brief pause to ensure the sheet update is committed                  |
| 6️⃣  | **Retrieve Latest Row**         | Fetches the newest sheet entry for image processing                  |
| 7️⃣  | **Fetch or Skip Image**         | Attempts to download the AI‑provided image URL; skips if unavailable |
| 8️⃣  | **LinkedIn Post Creation**      | Publishes your post on LinkedIn, embedding the image if present      |
| 9️⃣  | **Update Row as Posted**        | Marks the row with a ✅ under “Posted” for tracking                   |
| 🔟   | **Final Telegram Notification** | Confirms the successful LinkedIn upload                              |

* **OpenAI API Key** (for Chat models)
* **Telegram Bot Token**
* **Google Service Account** with Sheets API enabled and credentials JSON
* **LinkedIn OAuth2 App** credentials
* **LangChain n8n Nodes** installed (`@n8n/nodes-langchain`)

---

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone this repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dev34250/n8n-LinkedIn.git
   cd n8n-LinkedIn
   ```
2. **Import Workflow**:

   * Log in to your n8n instance.
   * Go to **Workflows → Import from File** and upload `linkedin-auto-poster.json`.
3. **Install Required Nodes** (if not already):

   ```bash
   npm install @n8n/nodes-langchain
   ```
4. **Add Credentials**:

   * **OpenAI**: Paste your API key under Credentials > OpenAI
   * **Telegram**: Add your Bot Token
   * **Google Sheets**: Upload your Service Account JSON and share the sheet
   * **LinkedIn**: Configure OAuth2 App (Client ID & Secret)

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit the following n8n nodes with your custom prompts and IDs:

* **Agent (Content)**: Your main prompt for generating LinkedIn copy.
* **AI Agent (Image)**: Prompt for searching/generating image based on the content.
* **Schedule Trigger**: Adjust the daily posting time if needed.
* **Google Sheets Nodes**: Set your Sheet URL and Sheet ID.
* **Telegram Nodes**: Use your chat ID for notifications.
* **LinkedIn Nodes**: Set your `person` URN (e.g., `TL70CRNMhK`).

---

## 💡 Usage

* Once configured, the workflow will run automatically every day at 11:00 AM.
* Monitor runs in the n8n UI. Logs will indicate any HTTP or API errors.
* Check your Google Sheet to view recorded posts and statuses.
* Telegram messages will notify you:

  1. When content is generated
  2. When content is saved to Sheets
  3. When the post is published on LinkedIn

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

* **OAuth errors**: Re-authenticate credentials in n8n, ensure scopes are correct.
* **Sheet not found**: Verify the Google Sheet URL and that the service account has edit access.
* **LinkedIn failures**: Confirm your OAuth2 App credentials and URN format.
* **Image fetch errors**: Check that the URL returned by the AI agent is publicly accessible.
* **Workflow stops**: Inspect n8n Execution Logs for stack traces and retry failed nodes manually.
